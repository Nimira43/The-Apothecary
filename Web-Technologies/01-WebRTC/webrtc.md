### WebRTC

###### WebRTC, or Web Real-Time Communication, is a technology that allows web browsers and mobile apps to communicate directly with each other in real time. It enables things like video calls, voice chats, and file sharing without needing to install extra plugins or software

##### Here’s how it works

###### Peer-to-Peer Communication: Instead of sending data through a central server, WebRTC connects devices directly. This makes communication faster and more efficient

###### Media Sharing: It allows secure access to your device's microphone, camera, or screen for sharing audio, video, or even your desktop

###### Data Channels: Beyond media, WebRTC can also transfer files or other data between devices

###### You’ve probably used WebRTC without realising it - apps like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and even some online gaming platforms rely on it for smooth, real-time interactions
